'select_data.py' is the code used to create the CSV file 'pitcher_data.csv' which extracted the analyzed data from the master CSV. All other files require the 'pitcher_data.csv' to read.

'pitch_counts.py' and 'success_rates.py' requires the pandas package.

'breakdowns.py', 'spin_rates.py', and 'sequence_data.py' create the final visualizations. In order to run these files pandas and numpy packages are needed. 'spin_rates.py' also requires the Matplotlib library.

'results.pdf' is the final presentable results with visualizations.
